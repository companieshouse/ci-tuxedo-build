| `libstdc++-libc6.2-2.so.3` | Required build and runtime dependency for [chl-tuxedo](https://github.com/companieshouse/chl-tuxedo/) project |

##Â SQL*Net Configuration

[fil-tuxedo](https://github.com/companieshouse/fil-tuxedo/) builds require a `tnsnames.ora` file with suitable Oracle database connection details. This file must be present in the build directory when building container images from this repository (i.e. it is required by a `COPY` instruction). However, the file is not committed to this public repository to avoid exposing connection details. The file is instead created in a separate task in the CI pipeline associated with this repository, before the image build is executed.
